# Sliding puzzle solution checker.

This modular program uses an algorithm that relies on various mathematical proofs in order to deduce whether any square sliding puzzle is solvable or not. Furthermore, when its solvable it provides you with a lower boundary of the minimum required moves in order to solve the puzzle.

## Installing / Getting started

Python Interpreter 3+ is required in order to compile the code, you may build this into an executable through other means if you wish. 
Standard compilation is all that is needed.

```shell
python sliding_puzzle_main.py
```

Once the code is executed, follow the instructions on the screen.

## Developing

```shell
git clone https://github.com/faycalki/sliding_puzzle_checker.git
```

## Features

* Efficiently computes whether the square array is solvable or not;
* Minimal dependencies;
* Can be implemented as a fully modular program with minimal editing.
* Provides you with a lower boundary minimum number of moves to solve the puzzle (when its solvable).
